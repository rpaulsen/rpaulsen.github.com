before the internet existed, I would probably have to go to a library to find out. 
Let’s face it–that’s not going to happen. So, I’m going with stormy.

Amid the ominous clash of (unverified) thunder, I was born. 
I spent the majority of my childhood living in Downers Grove outside of Chicago. 
Growing up my family never had cable television which gave me the opportunity to read 
books with Levar Burton, learn to love science with Bill Nye and learn life lessons from 
Mr. Conductor himself, George Carlin (who I am almost certain would tell you *Swiper, 
no swiping* is bullshit). Many years and deep dish pizzas later, I ended up moving to Atlanta.

In 2010, I graduated with highest honors from Georgia Tech with a B.S. in Computer Science. 
In pursuit of my degree I focussed on networks and human-computer interaction; 
I’m all about getting bits to the right place and making them useful when they get there. 
After graduation I remained in Atlanta and got a job with Appelrouth Tutoring Services as a 
web developer. I help make tools to allow students to prepare for the SAT, ACT, etc… online.

When not working, I spend my time watching television & film, tweaking gadgets, stargazing, 
and sitting (lots of sitting). Sometimes when I am feeling particularly adventurous I sit 
and watch television as the same time (I know what you are thinking, but I’m very careful). 
I am a huge fan of science fiction, horror films, and classic television cartoons.

I’ll leave you with one of my favorite George Carlin monologues which just about sums everything up.
